    # an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating
    # the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the

    # restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this
    # case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the
    # “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop
    # Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for
    # short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.
